Todo:
- Design coordinate system
  - World coordinates and object instance coordinates
- Translate screen coordinates to world coordinates
- Save object's x, y, and z positions inside mesh's modified struct
- Select objects by clicking them instead of clicking the list item
- Select multiple objects at once and combine them to the same instance
- Interactable move, scale and rotation arrow for objects
- Change mesh colors from the debug UI
- Add adjustable fps limit to debug UI settings
- Add debugUi intervals to debug UI
- Add separate colos for highlighted current mesh and selected meshes
- Add lighting parameters to light's parameters in debug UI
  - specular strength
  - specular shininess
  - ambient strength
  - Fadeout options:
    - linear
    - quadratic
    
  - spotlight options
    - cutOff
    - outerCutOff
    
- Add Gouraud/Phong lighting option to light's parameters in debug UI
- Add fragment shader's default ambience to system wide settings in debug UI

Bugs:
- When selecting an object, highlight color doesn't show up
  - Selected object needs to be moved to the end of the meshlist vector show that it will be drawn last
- Object mesh pointer is a bit buggy. Sometimes doesn't move up, goes beyond the object bounds.


Done:
- Draw FPS and other info to the screen
- Select multiple objects at once

Fixed bugs:
- Moving objects in Z axis doesn't work
