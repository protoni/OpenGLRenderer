Ideas:
- Select objects by clicking them instead of clicking the list item
- Select multiple objects at once
- Select multiple objects at once and combine them to the same instance

Bugs:
- When selecting an object, highlight color doesn't show up
  - Selected object needs to be moved to the end of the meshlist vector show that it will be drawn last
